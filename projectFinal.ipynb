    "## General Problem Statement:\n",
    "The problem statement for the analysis of the auto dataset is to determine the factors that influence the price of a car and to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on its characteristics. The objective is to identify the key variables that contribute to the price of a car and to evaluate the performance of a multiple linear regression model in terms of their ability to predict the price of a car. Additionally, the study aims to explore any patterns or relationships between the car characteristics and the price, and to draw conclusions about the best approach for predicting the price of a car.\n",

    "2. How well can a multiple linear regression model predict the price of a car?\n",

    "## Feature Extraction\n",
    "Feature extraction is a crucial step in the data analysis process as it involves identifying the most relevant and important features that have a significant impact on the outcome being studied. In the case of the 1985 Auto Imports dataset, Stepwise Regression and residual plots will be utilized to conduct the feature extraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stepwise regression is a feature selection method that iteratively adds or removes variables based on statistical criteria, while residual plots are used to visualize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the target variable. By combining these two methods, it is possible to identify the most significant predictors that contribute to the variability of the target variable and extract them for further analysis and modeling. This will provide a more parsimonious and interpretable model, as well as improve the model's predictive performance."
